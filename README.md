## The problem

Optimizing the performance of React Native apps is a complicated task. You need to profile the app, observe render patterns, apply memoization in the right places, etc. The results are often impressive, but also fragile. It's easy to introduce performance issues without even realizing.
Especially in a large project, in a large team, when shipping new features at a fast pace.
On the other hand, requiring developers to manually analyze performance as a part of the PR review process is not a feasible solution either.

## The solution

Reassure allows you to automate React Native profiling on CI, or your local machine. The same way you write your
integration and unit tests that automatically verify that your app is still _working correctly_, you can write
performance tests that verify that your app still _working performantly_.

Actually, performance tests written using Reassure look very similar to integration tests written using
[React Native Testing Library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library). That's because we
build Reassure on top of it, so that you can reuse your integration test scenarios as performance tests.

Reassure works by measuring render characteristics (render duration and count) of your modified code ("current", e.g your PR branch) and comparing that to render characteristics of the stable version of your code ("baseline", usually your `main` branch). We do it many times to reduce impact of random variations in render times. Then we apply statistical analysis to figure out whether the code changes are statistically significant. Finally, we generate a human-readable report summarizing our findings and displaying it on the CI.

## Installation and setup

In order to install Reassure run following command in your app folder:

Using yarn

```sh
yarn add --dev @reassure/reassure
```

Using npm

```sh
npm install --save-dev @reassure/reassure
```

You will also need a working [React Native Testing Library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library#installation)
and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) setup.

### Writing your first test

Next you can write you first test scenario:

```ts
// ComponentUnderTest.perf-test.tsx
import { measurePerformance } from '@reassure/reassure';

test('Simple test', async () => {
  await measurePerformance(<ComponentUnderTest />);
});
```

This test will measure render times of `ComponentUnderTest` during mounting and resulting sync effects.

Your file should have `perf-test.js`/`perf-test.tsx` extensions in order to separate it from regular test files.
Reassure will automatically match test filenames using Jest's `--testMatch` option with value
`"<rootDir>/**/*.perf-test.[jt]s?(x)"`.

#### Writing async tests

If your component contains any async logic or you want to test some interaction you should pass `scenario` option:

```ts
import { measurePerformance } from '@reassure/reassure';
import { RenderAPI, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';

test('Test with scenario', async () => {
  const scenario = async (screen: RenderAPI) => {
    fireEvent.press(screen.getByText('Go'));
    await screen.findByText('Done');
  };

  await measurePerformance(<ComponentUnderTest />, { scenario });
});
```

The body of `scenario` function is using familiar React Native Testing Library methods.

If your test contains any async changes, you will need to make sure that the scenario waits for these changes to settle, e.g. using
`findBy` queries, `waitFor` or `waitForElementToBeRemoved` functions from RNTL.

For more examples look into our [test examples app](https://github.com/callstack-internal/reassure/tree/main/examples/native/src/__tests__).

### Optional: ESLint setup

ESLint might require you to have at least one `expect` statement in each of your tests. In order to avoid this requirement
for performance tests you can add following override to your `.eslintrc` file:

```js
rules: {
 'jest/expect-expect': [
 'error',
    { assertFunctionNames: ['measurePerformance'] },
  ],
}
```

### Measuring test performance

In order to measure your first test performance you need to run following command in terminal:

```sh
> yarn reassure measure
```

This command will run your tests multiple times using Jest, gathering render statistics, and will write them to
`.reassure/current.perf` file. In order to check your setup, check if the output file exists after running the
command for the first time.

### Write performance testing script

In order to detect performance changes, you need to measure the performance of two versions of your code
current (your modified code), and baseline (your reference point, e.g. `main` branch). In order to measure performance
on two different branches you need to either switch branches in git or clone two copies of your repository.

We want to automate this task, so it can run on the CI. In order to do that you will need to create a
performance testing script. You should save it in your repository, e.g. as `reassure-tests.sh`.

A simple version of such script, using branch changing approach is as follows:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
BASELINE_BRANCH=${BASELINE_BRANCH:="main"}

# Gather baseline perf measurements
git checkout "$BASELINE_BRANCH";
npx reassure measure --baseline

# Gather current perf measurements
git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH";
npx reassure measure

# Compare results
npx reassure compare
```

### CI integration

As a final setup step you need to configure your CI to run the performance testing script and output the result.
For presenting output at the moment we integrate with Danger JS, which supports all major CI tools.

You will need a working [Danger JS setup](https://danger.systems/js/guides/getting_started.html).

Then add Reassure Danger JS plugin to your dangerfile :

```ts
import path from 'path';
import reassure from './packages/reassure/plugins';

reassure({
  inputFilePath: path.join(__dirname, './examples/native/.reassure/output.md'),
});
```

You can also check our example [Dangerfile](https://github.com/callstack-internal/reassure/blob/main/dangerfile.ts).

Finally run both performance testing script & danger in your CI config:

```yaml
- name: Run performance testing script
 run: ./reassure-tests.sh

- name: Run danger.js
 uses: danger/danger-js@9.1.6
 env:
 GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

You can also check our example [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/callstack-internal/reassure/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml).

> **Note**: Your performance test will run much longer than regular integration tests. It's because we run each test scenario multiple times (by default 10), and we repeat that for two branches of your code. Hence, each test will run 20 times by default. That's unless you increase that number even higher.

## Assessing CI stability

During performance measurements we measure React component render times in milliseconds, aka wall clock time. This means
that the same code will run faster (less ms) on faster machines and slower (more ms) on slower machines. For this reason,
baseline & current measurements need to be run on the same machine. Optimally, they should be run one after another.

Moreover, in order to achieve meaningful results your CI agent needs to have stable performance. It does not matter
really if your agent is fast or slow as long as it is consistent in its performance. That's why during the performance
tests the agent should not be used for any other work that might impact measuring render times.

In order to help you assess your machine stability, you can use `reassure check-stability` command. It runs performance
measurements twice for the current code, so baseline and current measurements refer to the same code. In such case the
expected changes are 0% (no change). The degree of random performance changes will reflect the stability of your machine.
This command can be run both on CI and local machines.

Normally, the random changes should be below 5%. Results of 10% and more considered too high and mean that you should
work on tweaking your machine stability.

> **Note**: As a trick of last resort you can increase the `run` option, from the default value of 10 to 20, 50 or even 100, for all or some of your tests, based on the assumption that more test runs will even out measurement fluctuations. That will however make your tests run even longer than normally.

You can refer to our example [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/callstack-internal/reassure/blob/main/.github/workflows/stability.yml).

## Analyzing results

<img src="./docs/report-markdown.jpg" width="830px" alt="Markdown report" />

Looking at the example you can notice that test scenarios can be assigned to certain categories:

- **Significant Changes To Render Duration** shows test scenario where the change is statistically significant and **should** be looked into as it marks a potential performance loss/improvement
- **Meaningless Changes To Render Duration** shows test scenarios where the change that statistically meaningless, i.e. is random noise
- **Insignificant Changes To Render Duration** shows change that cannot be easily categorized as significant or meaningless.
- **Changes To Render Count** shows test scenarios where render count did change
- **Added Scenarios** shows test scenarios which do not exist in the baseline measurements
- **Removed Scenarios** shows test scenarios which do not exist in the current measurements

## API

### Measurements

#### `measurePerformance` function

Custom wrapper for the RNTL `render` function responsible for rendering the passed screen inside a `React.Profiler` component,
measuring its performance and writing results to the output file. You can use optional `options` object allows customizing aspects
of the testing

```ts
async function measureRender(ui: React.ReactElement, options?: MeasureOptions): Promise<MeasureRenderResult> {
```

#### `MeasureOptions` type

```ts
interface MeasureOptions {
  runs?: number;
  dropWorst?: number;
  wrapper?: (node: React.ReactElement) => JSX.Element;
  scenario?: (view: RenderAPI) => Promise<any>;
}
```

- **`runs`**: number of runs per series for the particular test
- **`dropWorst`**: number of worst (highest) runs dropped from a test series
- **`wrapper`**: custom JSX wrapper, such as a `<Provider />` component, which the ui needs to be wrapped with
- **`scenario`**: a custom async function, which defines user interaction within the ui by utilized RNTL functions

### Configuration

#### Default configuration

The default config which will be used by the measuring script. This configuration object can be overridden with the use
of the `configure` function.

```ts
type Config = {
  runs?: number;
  dropWorst?: number;
  outputFile?: string;
  verbose?: boolean;
};
```

```ts
const defaultConfig: Config = {
  runs: 10,
  dropWorst: 1,
  outputFile: '.reassure/current.perf',
  verbose: false,
};
```

**`runs`**: number of repeated runs in a series per test (allows for higher accuracy by aggregating more data). Should be handled with care.
**`dropWorst`**: number of worst dropped results from the series per test (used to remove test run outliers)
dropWorst
**`outputFile`**: name of the file the records will be saved to
**`verbose`**: make Reassure log more, e.g. for debugging purposes

#### `configure` function

```ts
function configure(customConfig: Partial<Config>): void
```

You can use the `configure` function to override the default config parameters.

#### `resetToDefault` function

```ts
resetToDefault(): void
```

Reset current config to the original `defaultConfig` object
