This is an example project for [reassure](https://www.callstack.com/open-source/reassure) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
​
## Getting Started
​
First, make sure you have installed your packages, run:
​
```bash
yarn
```
​
Then, you can also run the development server for Next.js using:
​
```bash
yarn dev
```
​
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
​
## Running Performance tests
​
Having the modules installed, from the root directory, run:
​
```bash
yarn reassure
```
​
The command should automatically run the `measure` script and record measurements for all test cases
